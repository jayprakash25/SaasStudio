    question: "I'm not into tech. Can you explain the process in simple terms?",
    answer:
      "Yes, for sure. We'll start by discussing your goals and ideas. Then, I'll create a design for your approval. Once you're happy with the look, I'll build the actual website. We'll review it together, make any necessary changes, and then launch it. Throughout the process, I'll explain everything in plain language and guide you every step of the way.",

  {
    question:
      "My current website isn't bringing in customers. How can you help?",
    answer:
      "I'll start by analyzing your current site to identify issues. Often, problems can range from outdated design to poor user experience or lack of proper SEO. I'll then create a new site that's not only visually appealing but also optimized for search engines and designed to convert visitors into customers. We'll focus on clear calls-to-action, fast loading times, and mobile responsiveness to help attract and retain more customers.",

    question:
      "I'm on a tight budget. Do you have options for small businesses?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I understand budget constraints and offer flexible options. We can start with a simple but effective website and add features over time as your business grows. I also offer payment plans to spread out the cost. Let's discuss your specific needs and budget, and I'll propose a solution that gives you the best value for your investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need changes after the site goes live?",
    answer:
      "That's completely normal and expected. Websites often need adjustments as you see how they perform in the real world. I offer a 30-day period after launch where I'll make minor changes and adjustments at no extra cost. Beyond that, I'm always available for updates, whether it's small changes or adding new features. We can discuss ongoing maintenance packages if you'd like regular support.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take before my new website is up and running?",
    answer:
      "The timeline can vary depending on the complexity of the project. A simple website can be ready in as little as a week, while more complex sites may take longer. I'll provide a detailed timeline during our initial consultation.",
